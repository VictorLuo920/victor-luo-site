Hi! If you’re reading this, you’re reading the very first blog post of my brand new site! 

My name is Victor Luo and I’m a JAMSTACK developer. I started my web development journey with General Assembly in March 2020, right at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. While I had intended to attend GA’s Software Engineering Immersive in-person, I made the quick decision to remain committed to the transition to online instruction, which was great preparation for the “brave new world” of remote work. 

At General Assembly, I began working on the preliminary concept models for features I wanted to integrate into The Comedy Bureau, a website where users can find a lot of information about comedy events in the Los Angeles area. After contacting the site’s owner, I began working with him to redesign a relaunched version of his site, which is currently in progress. 

After I finished General Assembly, I did some front end development with Coa, a startup based in the Bay Area that offers an online therapy marketplace. I built out the wireframe designs their UX designer mocked up using React and Chakra-UI, and taught myself Redux in the process. 

As a developer, I’m looking for projects that make an impact I can be proud of. With my current work at The Comedy Bureau, which I hope to write about in more detail in another post, I’m eager to see the kinds of interesting developments can happen in a space as unique and lively as the comedy scene here in Los Angeles. 

Please contact me through social media if you have any questions or if you’d just like to connect! I’m looking to write more posts here soon, but here’s a preview of topics I’m considering:

- Adventures in Javascript Development
- Dispatches from the Comedy Scene
- Reflections on Reading and Writing Fiction
